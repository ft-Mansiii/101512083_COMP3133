event emitter: an object that emits events and lets you listen for those events. some event emitters:
streams
servers
file readers
timers
emit("data", someValue); emit("end"); emit("error", errorObject);
so When you do:
fs.createReadStream(...)
You get a Readable Stream.
Readable streams come with predefined events:
Event name	Emitted when
"data"	A chunk (or row) is ready
"end"	No more data
"error"	Something went wrong
data, end, and error are predefined stream events emitted by Node.js and libraries like csv-parser; we don’t define them, we listen to them using .on().
